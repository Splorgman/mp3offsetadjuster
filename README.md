# What is this?

This is a tool for resident DJs of TheWaveVR to automatically set the proper offset on their MP3 files using Traktor cue points.

# How to use

1. Install NodeJS
2. Download this tool and unzip to a folder on your system
3. Open a command prompt and navigate to the folder
4. Type `npm install`
5. Type `node update.js <path to Collection.nml>` where `<path to Collection.nml>` is the full path to your Traktor collection file. This is normally something like `C:\Users\UserName\Documents\Native Instruments\Traktor 2.10.2\collection.nml` on Windows. You can login to Traktor and check under `File Management` to find the correct path.
6. Sit back and watch as the script inserts an offset comment for TheWaveVR into your MP3 ID3 tags automatically!
